**[Screen: Homepage loaded, desktop view]**

> "Hi Dr. Reynolds! I'm excited to show you the first draft of your new website.

Let me walk you through what I've built for you."

## 🖥️ Desktop Walkthrough (3-4 minutes)

### 1. Hero Section (30 seconds)
**[Scroll to top, show hero with your photo]**

> "Starting at the top, we have your hero section with a beautiful nature-inspired background that creates an immediate sense of calm. I've used your professional photo here with the headline 'Find calm in the chaos'—which speaks directly to the high-achieving adults you work with who are navigating anxiety and burnout. The 'Book a Consultation' button makes it easy for potential clients to take action right away."

**[Hover over button to show interaction]**

### 2. Intro Section (30 seconds)
**[Scroll down slowly to show fade-in animation]**

> "As we scroll down, you'll notice these smooth animations—everything fades in gently, which keeps the experience feeling peaceful and intentional. This section speaks to your ideal client: adults who are overwhelmed, high-achieving, and emotionally exhausted. I pulled this language directly from your profile to ensure it resonates with the people you serve best."

---

### 3. Specialties Section (45 seconds)
**[Pause on the three specialty cards]**

> "Here are your three core specialties: Anxiety & Panic, Trauma & PTSD, and Burnout & Perfectionism. I chose these based on your profile's emphasis on nervous system regulation, EMDR for trauma processing, and supporting high-achievers. Each card has a carefully selected image that matches the calming, nature-inspired theme we're using throughout the site. The circular images create visual softness, which feels more approachable than sharp edges."

---

### 4. Symptoms Section (30 seconds)
**[Scroll to symptoms list]**

> "This section addresses common symptoms your clients might be experiencing—persistent sadness, difficulty focusing, relationship struggles, exhaustion, and feeling overwhelmed. It's written in a compassionate, non-clinical way, and ends with reassurance: 'You don't have to do this all alone.' This helps potential clients feel seen and understood before they even reach out."

---

### 5. FAQ Section (30 seconds)
**[Click to expand one FAQ item]**

> "The FAQ section answers the most common questions: insurance, rates, and availability. I've included the split-view layout with a calming image on the left to keep the page visually interesting. The accordion format keeps it clean and scannable."

---

### 6. Education & About Sections (30 seconds)
**[Scroll through both sections]**

> "Here's your professional background—your Psy.D. from Pepperdine, your California license, EMDR certification, and professional affiliations. This builds credibility. And in the About section, I've highlighted your warm, collaborative approach and the evidence-based methods you use: CBT, EMDR, and mindfulness practices. This comes directly from your profile."

---

### 7. Office Section (30 seconds)
**[Show office image and address]**

> "This is the custom 'Our Office' section I created specifically for you. It mentions that you offer both in-person therapy in Santa Monica and telehealth for California clients. I've included your office address and described the space as calm, grounding, and private—which helps clients visualize what to expect when they visit."

---

### 8. CTA & Footer (20 seconds)
**[Scroll to bottom]**

> "Finally, we have a clear call-to-action: 'Get started today'—encouraging visitors to book their first session. The footer includes your contact information, office hours, and navigation links. I've also added legal links like Privacy Policy and Good Faith Estimate, which are important for a healthcare practice."

---

## 📱 Mobile Walkthrough (2-3 minutes)

**[Switch to mobile view / resize browser]**

> "Now let me show you how this looks on mobile, since many of your clients will be browsing on their phones."

### Mobile Navigation
**[Click hamburger menu]**

> "The navigation collapses into this clean menu icon. When you tap it, the menu slides out with your main links—Blog and Contact."

### Mobile Sections
**[Scroll through homepage on mobile]**

> "Everything adapts beautifully to smaller screens. The two-column layouts stack vertically, images resize proportionally, and all the text remains readable. The animations still work smoothly, creating that same premium feel on mobile."

**[Show hero, specialties cards stacked, FAQ accordion]**

> "Notice how the specialty cards stack nicely, the FAQ accordion is easy to tap and expand, and buttons are sized perfectly for touch interaction. The office section also stacks cleanly with the image on top and content below."

---

## 🎨 Design Choices Explanation (1 minute)

**[Back to desktop, scroll slowly through site]**

> "Let me quickly explain the design decisions I made:

> **Color Palette:** I moved away from the original lilac theme and chose earthy, calming tones—soft greens, warm browns, and neutral grays. These colors are associated with nature, growth, and stability, which aligns perfectly with therapy and healing.

> **Typography:** I used a serif font for headings to create a sense of professionalism and warmth, and a clean sans-serif for body text to ensure readability.

> **Images:** Every image was chosen to evoke calm—nature scenes, soft lighting, gentle textures. This creates an emotional tone before someone even reads the content.

> **Animations:** The subtle fade-in effects make the experience feel polished and modern without being distracting.

> **Layout:** I kept everything spacious and uncluttered, with plenty of white space, because visual calm supports the message of your practice."

## 🎯 Closing (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Homepage at top]**

> "So that's your new website, Dr. Reynolds! It's designed to attract your ideal clients—high-achieving adults dealing with anxiety, trauma, and burnout—and it clearly communicates your expertise, your approach, and how to get in touch. I'd love to hear your feedback. Are there any sections you'd like me to adjust, or any additional information you'd like to include? Thank you for reviewing this, and I look forward to your thoughts!"

1. **Speak slowly and clearly** - Pretend you're talking to a real client
2. **Pause between sections** - Give viewers time to absorb what they're seeing
3. **Use "you" and "your"** - Make it personal ("your clients," "your practice")
4. **Avoid jargon** - No "components," "React," "Tailwind"—use "section," "button," "layout"
5. **Show, don't just tell** - Actually click buttons, expand accordions, scroll smoothly
6. **Smile while talking** - It comes through in your voice!
7. **Test your audio** - Make sure your microphone is clear
8. **Practice once** - Do a quick dry run to time yourself
